Note: The node_modules directories for the React projects in Week-6 and Week-7 have been removed to reduce size or for version control purposes.
To restore the required dependencies and ensure the applications run correctly, navigate to each project folder and run the "npm install" command to install all packages listed in the package.json files.

Note: Repository link on GitLab for Week-8-Git excercises is this: https://gitlab.com/ragamayee.rev-group/gitdemo
